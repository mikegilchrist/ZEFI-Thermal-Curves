      Hi Ray,

      Can you send data to Mike to play with for how to run our stats, as
      I think you have the data for color association which we ran across
      three temperatures?  Please see his request below.

      thanks!
      Liz

Hi Liz,

I'm thinking about how to best describe the modeling of performance vs. 
temperature.  It would be helpful to work with some of the preliminary 
data you have.  Could you please send me data for the experiment where 
you have measurements across the widest range of temperatures?

Mike
