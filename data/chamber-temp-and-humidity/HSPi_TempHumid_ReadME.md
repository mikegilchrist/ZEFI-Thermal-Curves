HSPi Chamber Temp and Humidity ReadME
File naming convention: Abbreviation-for-Project-ID_Logger/Chamber-ID_Month_Day_Year.txt

These loggers are used to get an idea of what is the temperature that the bird is actually experiencing. It was placed in the bottom corner or the chamber. So the temperature is going to be lower on these readings than the chamber's built in temperature reader that is by the air flow on the ceiling. 

The loggers were setup and placed in the chamber after the chambers have had some time to heat up, but hours before the actual trial. During the final 30min that the male is in the chamber, a female is unveiled and the number of songs that the male sings is measured.

"HSPi_2_02_03_22"- This is the file's name and then the rest of the column is counting each reading/datapoint.
