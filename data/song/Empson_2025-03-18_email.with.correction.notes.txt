Hi Mike,

 

Here were the errors and solutions I found when going through the data myself.

 

Original data entries (birds and dates) missing corresponding more recent and more detailed data entries

1 T230 1 1 2022-02-23 0 NA 0 44.2 19.0
	

1 T230 NA NA 2022-02-13 NA 0 NA NA NA

This seems to be most likely a typo that for the trial where the male is “T230” and the date is "2022-02-13” it should actually be "2022-02-23”. Since that day is missing an observation from that bird.

4 T243 NA NA 2022-04-16 NA 44 NA NA NA

This seems to be an obvious typo that for the trials where the date is "2022-04-16” it should actually be "2022-04-15” as there is no record of a trial being ran on the April 16th 2022. Additionally, April 16th is missing and observation from each of those birds.

I don’t see T235_June_25_2022 in any of the datasheets or raw files. When I looked through Tamara’s scoring it seems to be that she had a typo in the bird ID column. This information is for “T234”.

6 T258 NA NA 2022-07-20 NA 19 NA NA NA

The trial for T258 on 2022-07-20 should be excluded, he was showing signs of extreme heat stress, so his trial ended early (we turned off the chamber and opened the door). The trail was redone a few days later. There are songs jut because the mic was left on due to the other trials for that day continuing.

 

Lastly,

It seems this trial was somehow missed being scored the first time around, I was able to find the raw data of this trail. I had Tamara score it and attached the data.

Subject: Inconsistent dates?

Hi,

I’m still trying to ensure I’m importing and processing the data correctly.

I believe the dates in the original data I was sent way back in 2023 and the more recent data have a few mismatches

I’m hoping the issues are due to typos in the newest data. Either way, could you please help me resolve these inconsistencies?

Thanks,

Mike
